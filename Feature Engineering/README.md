# Feature engineering

Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming variables (also known as features) in a dataset to make them more suitable for machine learning algorithms. The goal is to extract meaningful information from the raw data and create new features that capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

The process of feature engineering typically involves several steps, including:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing missing values, duplicates, and outliers from the dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most important features that are relevant to the problem at hand.
- **Feature Transformation**: Converting features into a format that can be more easily understood by machine learning algorithms.
- **Feature Creation**: Creating new features that capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

Feature engineering is a critical step in the machine learning process, as the quality and relevance of the features used can greatly impact the accuracy and performance of the model. It requires domain expertise and a deep understanding of the data to identify and create features that are both relevant and informative.
