# Forecasting using Machine Learning

In this directory I store all my experiments with forecasting. I will use this markdown file to write down valuable information that I want to remember not to forget crucial aspects of forecasting methods.

## Types of forecasting:

- Time-Series model
- Explanatory Forecast model
- Mixed model

## Forecasting algorithms:

- Regression models
- Exponential smoothing methods
- Box-Jenkins ARIMA models
- Dynamic regression models
- Hierarchical forecasting
- Neural networks
- Vector autoregression

## Time Series

### Types of time series forecasting

- Trend - time series has a clear long-term increase or decrease (may or may not be linear)
- Seasonal - time series affected by seasonal factors such as time of year (e.g increased sales towards end of year) or day of week
- Cyclic - time series shows rises and falls over an unfixed period, these tend to be longer/more variable than seasonal patterns

### Univariate and Multivariate time series data

- Univariate - **only one** variable (using the price of Bitcoin to predict the price of Bitcoin)
- Multivariate - **More than one** variable (using the price of Bitcoin as well as the block reward size to predict the price of bitcoin).
