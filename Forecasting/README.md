# Forecasting using Machine Learning

In this directory I store all my experiments with forecasting. I will use this markdown file to write down valuable information that I want to remember not to forget crucial aspects of forecasting methods.

## Types of forecasting:

- Time-Series model
- Explanatory Forecast model
- Mixed model

## Forecasting algorithms:

- Regression models
- Exponential smoothing methods
- Box-Jenkins ARIMA models
- Dynamic regression models
- Hierarchical forecasting
- Neural networks
- Vector autoregression
