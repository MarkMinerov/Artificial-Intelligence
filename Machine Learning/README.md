# Machine Learning Algorithms

Here I write about different algorithms and methods of Machine Learning. I will also post scripts where I implement one or another method of ML.

## Classification problem

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes Classifier

## Regression problem

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- Support Vector Regression
